# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Deep-Neural-Network
We use prima-indian-diabetes to predict diabetes with multiple input parameters . We achieve this goal by deep neural network implemented in Keras . 

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Prima Indaians Diabetes Database is one the famous database on kaggle with 8 input parameters and a binary class output . Given below is the description of Input parameters and the Output Classification .


Pregnancies -  Number of times pregnant
Glucose - Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure -  Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness -  Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin2 - Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function - Diabetes pedigree function
Age - Age (years)
Outcome - Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

Taking the 8 parameters as out input parameters and feeding them into a deep neural network with desiarable hidden layer and accurate function we can precicely classify the output as diabetic(1) or non-diabetic(0) for a person with particular characteristics .
